But I agree with Ben in that Larry should've sat in the front seat even if it's two minutes away and that he should've sang happy birthday. I don't care how much you hate the song, please sing happy birthday.

Einstein's death was a big shame and of course he will be a sorely missed in Season 10, but I really hope they can find a good reason for his character not being around. If you think about it there couldn't be a more perfect character to kill off than Marty Funkhouser. They killed his uncle, both his parents, and even his nephew in the previous season, so it would be fitting to have him join the ranks.

 If anyone could take the death of friend and turn it into comedy, it would be Larry David. 

Sad to see him gone, but also interested in seeing where that leaves his character.

* Mocha Joe is in nearly every episode.

* Episode 3 credits contain a host and waiter. More restaurant shenanigans?
* Episode 7 credits no actors at the moment. 
* Episode 8 lists the most actors. Does not necessarily mean much since some episodes only contain none or 1 or 2 actors at the moment. One actor plays a Castilian mourner. 
* Last two episodes credits contain a fireman played by the same actor. Possible two part storyline? ",curb,1552290398,m0rp,2,1,True,2019-03-11

Inside the McDonald's we saw a very attractive woman wearing a choker necklace. We both quietly talk amongst ourselves ""dude she's hot as fuck"" and that type of thing. It's worth noting that neither of us approached or harassed this woman in anyway, we left her alone. Anyways, theres a joke (or a belief if you're an incel) attached to chokers that they are a ""blowjob blackbelt"". So I brought up to my buddy that she has a blowjob blackbelt around her neck. My friend doesn't get it so I explain theres a joke that if a woman is wearing a choker, she gives amazing blowjobs. Hence, a blackbelt in blowjobs. I guess I spoke a little louder than I intended. Right behind me I hear an angry guy yell ""HEY!"" right into my ear. I turn around and theres this scary body builder looking dude holding his seemingly 4 or 5 year old daughter in his arms. Take a guess of what his daughter is wearing around her neck.... He calls me a degenerate, a disgusting pervert, and makes a scene while I try to explain myself. Everyone is staring at us so my friend and I booked it out of the McDonald's. I haven't returned since.  ",curb,1553299476,adobeeditor,26,103,True,2019-03-22

36,Differences between peak Curb and latter-day Curb,"Something I notice about latter episodes of Curb, aside from the fact that Larry is often actively trying to be an asshole, and the outlandish plots (Fatwa), is that he is constantly has a grin on his face as a default expression. 

It's symptomatic to me of latter day episodes being too self-aware.

I remember when I first got into Curb, and what got me into it, was Larry's curmudgeonly manner.

Now he just seems too giddy and happy all the time, and I think the tone suffers because of it. He seems to struggle to get through every scene without corpsing, or breaking character; it just all seems too smug to me.

It wasn't always like this. I always thought Larry was a pretty good actor for a novice but if I started watching from Season 6 or Season 7 I'd think he's pretty bad.

I've mentioned it on other threads, too, but Leon in Season 6 brought something new to the show, but IMO he outstayed his welcome beyond that and it doesn't really make sense for Larry and him to be in the same realm anymore.

The show always felt pretty realistic, like a faux documentary before this, but stuff like Leon's continued presence gave the show more of a sitcom feel and it doesn't work for me.

37,Who Would You Have Liked To See Guest Star In Curb Over The Years?,"Norm MacDonald

Nothing fancy. Just have them meet and exchange a few funny lines like he did with Martin Short.

Larry Thomas (guy who played the Soup Nazi in Seinfeld)

As regards Thomas, the guy makes a lot of appearances as the Soup Nazi and has kind of parlayed a guest role into a full time job. He's also quite protective of his intellectual property IIRC. I'd like to have seen Curb do something with this. Write some tension between him and Larry and hark back to Seinfeld.

Howard Stern 

Maybe have Larry guest on Howard's show within the Curb universe and have Larry manage to cause offense that even the king of shock jocks is taken aback by.

Any of David Letterman/Conan O'Brien/Jay Leno

Write the sitcom wars into the show and have Larry further underlying tension between the chat show hosts in his own inimitable way.

Sinead O'Connor

There's a lot of potential comedy and faux-pas to mine. One of Cheryl's charitable or environmental endeavours could be the lure to draw Sinead into Larry's laser sights.

Jennifer Lawrence

Larry is aware that Lawrence has a crush on him and it causes tension between him and a jealous Cheryl. After an interaction between Lawrence and Larry, Larry is left wondering if Lawrence is trying to set up a rendezvous. This sets up an internal conflict that drives the plot. A lot of potential for Jeff to figure heavily into this episode.

Larry Hankin

Renowned character actor that appeared on shows such as Seinfeld and Friends. I think he's the kind of guy who could work well within the Curb universe in any number of potential minor guest roles.

9,New Curb Fan Here!,"Hi all,   


I grew up ""in the hood"", and my dad always watched Seinfeld. I loved watching it with him when I came home from school and he from work. People kinda always teased him for watching, that and Star Trek Generations and Deep Space 9. Although we did watch shows like Martin, and others it always always looked at as dry humor to watch Seinfeld.  


Well now that I'm 30 and have my own family over 20 years later, I became the nerd my dad was. I love the Office, Seinfeld, King Of The Hill, Simpsons. and now that I have Amazon Prime, I'm binge watching Curb.   


First two episodes I thought man this is the funniest thing I've ever seen, there's no way it could continue to be this funny. It's like the office but the other direction. I get through the first season in a state of shock, instantly a Larry David fan, seeing how deeply he influenced the Seinfeld culture.   


Being Jewish is a huge plus also, and being black gets a + on episodes where he has his awkward situations with black people.

Larry having no real reason to go to New York City hurts the story for me. The Buckner episode might be my least favorite of the series aside from the Leon glasses bit. I also did not care for the periscope car/judge scrabble episode. I can sorta tell why the show went on a 5-year hiatus after this as it seems like Larry was running out of ideas.

As I also often do, I fell asleep halfway through and didn’t finish the episode. While asleep I had a pretty upsetting dream that I called home and my dad told me my mom had died and he didn’t tell me. I recall being pretty sad in the dream and woke myself up.

I haven’t seen that one for at least a year but it still managed to worm its way into my dream. It got me pretty, pretty, pretty good.

""The Dog"", ""The Baby Shower"", ""The Seinfled Chronicles"", or maybe you don't like the post LD era of Seinfeld.... in any event there are episodes that I simply can't rewatch. 

With Curb, it might not be the cultural force that Seinfeld is/was, but I can't think of a single episode that is simply not watchable. For me there is always a redeeming quality to every episode - the series in incredibly consistent.

14,Larry David and Lying,"I know this is obvious in a way, but I'd never put together how fundamental the act of \*lying\* is to Larry David's brand of comedy.  This is true for both George Costanza, and Larry's fictional self in Curb. He has a way of making lying so uniquely funny and inoffensive (where it's generally quite unfunny in reality). It's hilarious how commonplace dishonesty is to both of these characters' lives. I'm going to list some of my favourite lying moments for each below - what are your favourites?

\- George and Elaine working together on a lie in The Cadillac (Marisa Tomei!). ""We've never worked together on a lie before. Jerry and I have, and he knows how I work"" ""We're just trying to come up with the \*best possible lie\*"" ""It's not a lie..if you believe it""

\- In Ted and Mary, the aforementioned couple have invited Larry and Cheryl to a concert, but have not called them to make arrangements on the day of. "" At least lie to us. Call us and lie, don't let us sit here like schmucks. A lie is a gesture, it's a courtesy; it's a little respect. This is very disrespectful.""

\- George driving Susan's parents to his non-existent house in the Hamptons, knowing that they know he's lying. ""You don't let somebody lie when they know you're lying. You call them a liar!"" 

\- Larry encountering Alan Wasserman, prez of HBO, when their Chinese take-out orders get crossed-up. Later, with Cheryl: ""..the guy from HBO, the president of HBO. l got out of that special. I told him my stepfather got in an accident. ('Yeah, why did you make up a lie about a stepfather? You don't even have a stepfather') ""I just thought it was a better lie. Because if you make up a lie about a stepfather, you'll be believed, don't you think?""

\- It's too detailed to lay out the whole scenario, but I think my absolute favourite is Larry getting caught in a web of lies with Dr Blore, Burt Bondy, and eventually the Bartlett pear in Chet's Shirt. Nothing makes me laugh harder than seeing Larry laying on the ground with his teeth knocked out, seeing the web of lies closing in on him: ""Dr Blore....Burt Bondy.....""",curb,1534185621,RubbrWalrusProtector,3,42,True,2018-08-13

62,Larry David: A Reasonable Man in an Unreasonable World,"I love Curb Your Enthusiasm. I've watched every episode at least twice so far.
 
I love Larry David! He's a man who speaks his mind. I'd pay to just watch him eat and talk to Ricard Lewis. I would. 

But I feel a lot of the things people get mad about in this show are ridiculous. I don't want to bring up every instance that happens because this would go on forever. It’s like this, there’s this etiquette, this snobby-proper way of doing things and, when Larry goes against etiquette, or when he questions these things, people get unreasonably offended. It feels like walking on egg shells around these people. Do you know what I mean? 

For example, something that comes to mind right now is that episode where Larry meets Mel Brook’s secretary and she gets all pissed off because Larry suggests she name her Asian Baby “Tang”… Ok, now that I wrote that out, it does seem kind of offensive but her reaction to that was way over the top. You don’t have to name your Asian Baby “Tang” lady. It’s a joke. Jesus, calm down. 

Things like that. I feel like many of these arguments Larry gets into he’s being completely reasonably. That’s not say that every argument Larry gets into he is justified, sometimes he’s out of line, for sure but, I think for the most part he’s making a lot of sense to me. Does anyone else feel this way?

P.S. Wouldn’t it be cool if Larry David himself was subscribed to this Sub-Reddit? That’d be so cool.

63,Sidewalk Etiquette,"Now I'm posting this here because I believe Larry David would approve of my reasoning on this issue. Sidewalk etiquette. Yes, sidewalk etiquette. We learn it when we're 5 years old and yet it seems like everyone in my city has forgotten it.

Your standard North American side walk block is wide enough to facilitate two people standing next to each other, logically, so that two people walking in two different directions may pass each other with ease. A sidewalk is also treated like a road for pedestrians. Meaning that you stick to the right (like cars stick to the right side of the road). Perhaps this is different in other parts of the world, the people I see who stick to the right usually look foreign, but that's for a different time.

Now the key to sidewalk etiquette is learning how to file up and down if you are walking with friends. Two kids are walking down the street side by side, going in the same direction. Another kid is walking the opposite way. Proper etiquette dictates that one of the two kids takes lead and the other files up behind them briefly so that all three people can pass each other seemlessly. However, this is where most problems I see are.

Most people in my city do not know how to 'file up', yet the 5 year old kids who go to the local school can do it flawlessly.

I've had people literally stare at me while walking right in my direction with no intention to move. As if I am the one who is supposed to walk off the grass. I'm just as entitled to my half of the sidewalk as whoever is walking opposite as me, and I would never expect anyone to go on the grass for me. So in this instance I stand still, stare at them and wait for them to move, works every time.

I know this is completely ridiculous but I also feel like it could be something written into a Curb episode. If only we were all considerate of other people this would never even be a thing, but sadly it is.",curb,1536267489,hipnotyq,12,33,True,2018-09-06

47,"Revisited ""Ted and Mary,"" from season 1. Haven't seen most of these S1 eps in over a decade. This is a great episode.","It also seems illustrative of the relaxed vibes of the early days of the show. There was a lot of narrative slack, but in a good way. The scenes kind of listlessly unfold...the actors really seem to be taking their time through the material, and it doesn't seem carefully edited, so there's an exciting roughness to the whole thing that ends up making the experience of watching the show more compelling and relaxed somehow. It feels like you're being pulled into a conversation and a scenario, rather than being shown something that's been thoroughly edited and written.\*Curb\* is improvised in the later seasons, too, but I feel like it's a bit more contained later on (perhaps particularly in S9), and there's a bit more wiggle room for various reactions and moments in the early days.

Anyway: ""Ted and Mary."" It's a good episode. I wouldn't rank it so high if it didn't have Larry singing Paul Simon on that couch -- that moment is not only funny but almost weirdly moving as a tribute to the character, even though the series had barely begun at this point. That's sort of what I'm talking about when I'm referring to wiggle room and letting the improvisation breathe a bit more than in S9. All the stuff at the mall in this episode just drags on too long, but in the best way. 

I also revisited ""Affirmative Action"" recently, and, again, I love how much of the episode just plods along...it feels like an hour. People usually type stuff like that in a disparaging sense, but I mean it as high praise. I love that they make room for Larry to gloat about the GPS and call out to his father? ""Your son's not so stupid, daddy!"" or whatever he said.

...

We all know Cheryl leaves much to be desired in the realm of coaster usage; in that regard, her wood respect is lacking and I cannot defend her.

But before we dismiss her as a heinous wood disrespecter, remember this: In ""[Lefty Call](http://curb-your-enthusiasm.wikia.com/wiki/The_Lefty_Call)"" (Season 6, Episode 4), it was Cheryl who tirelessly campaigned for the use of environmentally-friendly, Port Authority-esque toilet paper, despite the surreptitious efforts of Larry and the Blacks, who insisted on using tree-killing, global-warming causing regular toilet paper.

Also, she is an active and sincere fundraising member of the Natural Resources Defense Council [(NRDC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_Resources_Defense_Council)... while Larry seems less-than-enthusiastic about such causes, and only really plays along to appease Cheryl.

All things considered, and as shocking as it is to say out loud, I think *Cheryl actually respects wood more than Larry* based on the evidence.",curb,1528139080,bleegerued,10,35,True,2018-06-04

Larry and Richard are walking out of a restaurant after having a huge argument (Larry is mad at Richard) 

R: Look Larr, I'm sorry, I really am.

L: Yeah well you said some pretty rough stuff in there y'know, some pretty nasty stuff.

R: I know I know,  I just really hope you'll be able to forgive me. I honestly feel bad about it.

L: You know what: I won't accept your apology.

R: Whaddaya mean you won't accept my apology? It’s a sincere apology, you can't not accept a sincere apology

L:  (Larry in a mad tone) Well I'm doing it right now, I'm not accepting it 

R: (Richard being flustered) Larry this is ridiculous, the only rule to apologizing is that it has to be sinecre, if it's sincere you have to accept it

L: Well frankly Richard I'm still mad at you, so I see no reason to why I should accept it. It might be the most sincere apology of all time, I couldn't give any less of a shit.

R: Larr this is ridiculous, just ridiculous, I mean I don't even know what to say

L: it’s very simple: I’m still mad and I don’t want to accept it


R: Look I get that you’re mad, but you can at least accept it. You can accept it and then you can continue being mad for awhile. Accepting it is just a courteous thing to do.

L: Maybe I don’t feel very courteous today, maybe I don’t want to follow conventional apology rules right now

R: Jesus Larry you need help, man. You know that?

L: I don’t think I’m the one who needs help I think YOU are the one who needs to learn some manners

R: Christ Larry I’ve just spent the last five minutes trying to get you to accept my apology, isn’t that enough?

L: I can’t talk to you right now, I’m gonna go to Jeff’s office and see what he’s up to.

31,Please tell me... is the rest of Season 10 as awful as the first episode?,"I was nothing less than traumatized upon seeing the first one. I was worried I might be disappointed, but NOTHING could have prepared me for just how bad it was going to be.

So we start out in the shower and I’m loving it. It’s typical Larry with this mundane thing we’ve all experienced screwing up and he handles it in his hilariously unusual way, battering the soap container until he creates a tear as opposed to giving up and getting a different soap.

And then we get to the door holding scene. Now, I’m a little disheartened because this scenario is so predictable—I could tell right away that later on Larry would hold the door open for someone else as he’s been instructed, and he would get berated all the same, which did happen. But, it was still alright.

Immediately after I have another “I know exactly what’s going to happen” moment when he texts Louis about the dead parrot and makes light of it. I knew right away that someone would later make light of Larry’s tragedy/problem which he wouldn’t appreciate, which also happens (direct from Louis himself in fact).

And then we get to the constipation conversation. This is where I became turned off. It had a level of bathroom humor I hadn’t seen Curb resort to before, but more importantly it was just so clumsily executed. The issue is brought up in a straight-forward way, talking at Larry’s desk. Not working because of constipation? Describing the bowel movements? There was nothing to make me go ha-ha. It was more like slowly dying inside as I realize this episode is not going to be even alright.

Fast forward, he breaks up a lesbian engagement by convincing the butch one that she should wear a suit, and he just so happens to walk into their house as they argue about this very thing in the front room. Yeah, okay. One thing that is so special about Curb/Seinfeld is that the situations seem wild and yet at the same time entirely realistic, that although it’s crazy, that it is at the same time in some way feasible. It just felt so ham-handed, to slap that encounter together with him just happening to walk in at the exact time of the girlfriend breaking up with the hairdresser vs. the argument coming up organically and possibly as a result of Larry bringing it up.

Moving on, he goes on Kimmel and makes an idiot of himself, okay, there will be a lot of backlash, we can see this coming a mile off.

He gets into disguise after the ensuing fatwa is issued. Although it is somewhat amusing to see him in a wig, at this point, I’m too much in a dour mood to be too uplifted. Then the hairdresser’s girlfriend comes looking for him in the restaurant and he runs around the room to avoid her as the camera uses a sort of bird’s eye shot. To me it was kind of eye roll inducing though, seeing him kowtow to the angry lesbian. And her coming to seek him out just wasn’t set up with the usual finesse. We don’t know what she wants, and frankly we don’t really care.

The one subplot that did contain a glimmer of previous Curb genius is the “foisting” bit. I actually didn’t predict that Leon would suggest Larry get rid of the assistant by repeating what was done to him, and when Larry does, it ends in a way that both surprises and delights. Susie finally not only fires the “unfireable” girl but satisfyingly lambasts her, hence ending the foisting cycle, and proceeds to close the episode by punching Larry in the face while he’s in the shower. All excellent.

In close, the whole episode just felt “safe”. It felt like he was just uninspiredly following a formula and wanting to put out an episode that wouldn’t offend, wouldn’t toe the line, but at the cost of its raw brilliance—it was like watching someone *pretend* to be themselves, in some way.

I never thought I would regret Larry David putting out a season, but if the others are anything like this shadow-of-itself episode, I would regret it coming back.

So I want to know if the other episodes are the same as this first one in terms of blatant predictability, lack of organic lead up to events, and general death of its Curb charm. Please tell me…

36,I tried introducing Curb Your Enthusiasm to my parents. This is what happened.,"I started with The Doll with both of them. My dad's first comment was ""this seems a documentary"". I said yeah, that's kind of the purpose with the earlier seasons, but it'll get funny soon. He left the couch a few times because he couldn't handle the second-hand embarrassment coming from Larry David. I explained that George Costanza (he enjoys the Seinfeld show) is based on Larry David, and that they're kind of alike in the way that they obsess about minor details, social conventions, and easily get into conflicts. He said that he didn't see much George in Larry. He also called Larry ""quite an annoying character."" He left the couch a few times during the viewing and missed the ending of the episode.

During the opening of ""Denise Handicapped"" when we realize that the woman Larry asks out is in a wheelchair, he said ""oh no... no thanks"" and left."" I think it's a brilliant episode but he didn't like where it was going.

My mom sat through the entire episode of ""The Doll"" and five minutes into the episode she asked, ""does he know that he's being filmed?"". She also praised the strong female characters in the show.

The second episode she watched happened to be ""The Divorce"" and she walked out as soon as the Dodgers' owner's daughter reveals that she just had her first period, by saying ""I don't think this is funny anymore.""

Larry: Suzy! Suz-ay, Suz-ay, Suz-aaaayyyy! I got something for you.

Susie: Aww Lar' you shouldn't have. Y'see Jeff, this is a man capable of change. A man capable of conscientiousness. A prime example of what you should strive to be.

Jeff: Mhmmm

Susie: Yea, right, you're listening.

Jeff: Larry's the better man, I should be more like Larry

Larry: That's right. 

Jeff: I'll start by shaving my head.

Larry: *gesturing with his hand back and forth* Then the glasses, then the good humor...

Susie: Alright, alright, I still want some sexual attraction in the mix

Larry: Oh! What I'm not a sexually attractive man? As I am?

Susie: Lar' you look like shit. You whine, you look like you whine. Jeff is a dog. But he listens. You? You don't shut up and how Cheryl did it for all the years *waving her hands* I don't know

Larry: Well maybe I'll just keep the gift then and find someone who will stroke my ego for a kind gesture.

Susie: No, no! come one then, your a man, better then Jeff, just less Jeff-y. Which is good. Believe me. So what you got for me.

Larry: *leaning in* A fanny stretcher. 

Susie: Oh you sick fuck. I knew it the second you walked in here you would have some perverted nonsensical to try and force upon my body. 

Larry: No, no its for you're fanny pack. 

Susie: A fanny what? Pack? I don't want anything packed in my fanny.

Larry: Are you kiddin' me *half laughing* You were what, 40 during the 80s? Everyone had them.

Susie: What did you try to insinuate about my age?

Larry: Women your age tend to wear them. I figured you could, er uhhhhh, y'know use it to make more room in yours for your accessories. 

Susie: My accessories? In my ""fanny pack""

Larry: Yes! *gesturing up to down with his hand and head*

Susie: Let me tell you something. I don't want you worrying about my fanny or my accessories. If I have to Carry them I'LL FUCKING CARRY THEM OR MAKE THIS FAT FUCK DO IT FOR ME. 

Larry: He can't walk and carry accessories! 

Jeff: It's true, I'm not coordinated enough. Not well built.

Susie: **WE ALL KNOW THAT. YOU WERE WHEEZING WHEN I CALL YOU UPSTAIRS FOR A FROZEN YOGURT THIS MORNING!**

Larry: *to Jeff* A frozen yogurt in the morning? 

Jeff: *To Larry* Doctor says Haggen-Daz is bad for my numbers tapping his chest

Susie: I'm done with this conversation. Larry take your perverted fanny fuck thing with you when you go. 

Larry: Well fine! I'll just use it myself.

Susie: Oh, right, yea go ahead. Expand your skinny ass all over. Men your age need to do more of that. Degenerate bald fuck...

*Susie exits*

Larry: *pointing and smiling at Jeff towards Suzy* You believe that?

Jeff: Unbelievable. 

Larry: ...you know anyone who wants a fanny pack expander? I really don't have one or want to be one of those guys whose using one. 

Jeff: No, all my friends use ""Murses""

*Larry spends the rest of the episode trying to give away the fanny pack expander. Richard Lewis gets upset at Larry for offering it to his girlfriend even though she accepts it. Larry gets mad that the mailman keeps giving him unwanted flyers to local grocery stores.*

In the S7 Episode, ""The Table Read"" - Michael Richards is incredibly worried that he may have Groat's Disease and is introduced by Larry to Leon (disguised as Danny Duberstein) convincing him he doesn't have a disease and is totally fine. 

This is mirrored in Seinfeld when George convinces Kramer  to pose as Dermatologist Dr. van Nostrand to take a look at/dispel the mole of his boss Kruger.

3,Courtesy Pause (fan fiction),"Larry is on a date with a woman, it’s going well.

After dinner Larry uses toothpick profusely, turns off his date. 

LD: ""You know, the toothpick, is highly underrated. Nothing worse than having a chunk of masticated food stuck between your teeth.” 

Larry digs deep with toothpick, date looks away disgusted. 

/

Larry and date get back to Larry's. 

LD: ""So, you want to come in for a coffee?""

Her: [right away] ""No.""

LD: ""What, just like that? No courtesy pause? Like you were waiting for the question and already had your answer. At least take a couple of seconds to pretend like you're thinking about it. Like you want to come in but you have an early day tomorrow so you're conflicted."" 

Her: [weirded out] ""Look Larry, I had a good time, but I think I'd just like to go home.""

LD: ""Just a little courtesy pause. Three seconds!""

Her: ""Have a good night Larry.""

/

Later, Larry is talking to Leon. 

LD: ""Listen to this. Took this girl out last night. Invited in for coffee, and right away she says no.""

Leon: ""No courtesy pause??""

LD: ""No courtesy pause!!""

Leon: ""That shits fucked up Larry. You gotta give a courtesy pause. You ask someone to come up, that's at least 3 seconds. You're puttin' yourself out there. Takin' all the risk.""

LD: ""I know."" [frustrated]

Leon: ""Now, a favor, that shit you only gotta give a one second courtesy pause. Hey can you do this for me? [one second] No.""

LD: ""Exactly. Can you be my best man? That's a little more. Maybe five seconds.” 

Leon: “You’re god damn right. Let me tell you LD. You gotta get that shit on lock down. Prevent that courtesy pause from ever coming up, see what I'm sayin.""

LD: ""Ya, but how do you do that.""

Leon: ""You gotta be smoooooth, Larry. You gotta be chill. Will that shit into existence. Like a self-fulfilling prophecy.""

LD: “Alright, I gotta go.”

Leon: “Let me tell you what Larry. I'll tell this chick how it is. Educate this girl. Open up her mind. Show her the way of the courtesy pause. Who is she?”

Larry tells Leon where he met her and Leon goes to confront woman about courtesy pause.

/

Later, Larry sees Leon and woman being friendly together in Leon's car.

LD: ""What the hell are you doing?? You're supposed to enlighten her, not cuckold me!!”

Leon: ""It was the toothpickin’ Larry! Too much toothpickin’!!"" 

Leon squeals off with girl.

LD: “The toothpick is so underrated!!”

Those that know the show we’ll know that Seinfeld got bigger and zanier later on, since the concept and characters were so well established, and the same seems to be happening to Curb. Personally I love it, it keeps things a bit fresher, and I quite like the later seasons of shows going “bigger.” Some people seem to have expressed that, like some did with Seinfeld, that the zanier tone is a drop off in qualify compared to the simpler earlier episodes. I thought it was interesting to note, especially since Seinfeld became a bit crazier after Larry left, so you’d assume it was down to him that the show kept more grounded.

120,I get the feeling that this is the last season.,"Just watched the shucker episode. Larry is really trying to pack a lot in each episode. The whole Lin Miranda could've been it's own show. Same with the ficus/Judge Judy. All these guest appearances.

This whole season reminds me of the ""Series Finale"" type episodes where we see all the old characters one last time usually under spurious circumstances, except this time around it's not different characters but it's different aspects of Larry's character. I really started feeling this way around ep 8 this season with the Iranian mole taking inventory Larry.

121,I feel like I'm the only person who loves this season.,"It's not my favorite but then again, I don't really have them all. I always hear people say ""Larry has never been this much of an asshole or stupid!"", but I disagree. Yeah, they're times he's right, times where it's debatable, but I've never seen him as an etiquette/mannerism person or even good for that matter. He's always been an asshole and a hypocrite to me despite what others say. Don't get me wrong, I love him and what he does, but the same way in Kramer and George, 2 of my favorite sitcom characters. They're assholes/horrible people and don't think very well, yet that's why we love them. 

Plus, if you still see it, I think the reason why was because when he got separated/divorced from Cheryl, and Leon practically replaced him, perhaps he became a naturally worse person since he's living with someone 

People complained about the latter seasons of Seinfeld where he left until the Finale, which we most people hate, but I kind of liked it for the remeniance, but that's another thread in another forum. Anyway, back to the subject, some the latter seasons has some of my favorite/classic episodes like The Bizarro Jerry, The Little Kicks, The Chicken Roaster, The Yada Yada, The Voice, The Serenity Now, The Betrayal, The Merv Griffin Show, etc.

On top of that, maybe people will start loving the new season. For me, I didn't like the Season 7 finale, Seinfeld, that much. But eventually years later it became some of my favorite episodes.

I mean, I know there was brief time between seasons 2 and 3 where he and Susie got separated, but that's it. He seems to live with that woman half of his life and you can tell he's kind of unhappy with it with all the cheating. He wants to get a divorce, but he can't.

186,"Does anyone think this season had too many ""known"" guest stars not playing themselves?","I mean, when you think of it, it seems like it does compared to the others. Most of the time when A-lister or even a B-lister is on a show, they usually play themselves. But it seems like this season they decided to turn 360.

 I believe the biggest offender of them all was Bryan Cranston. At this point, I can't think of anyone as known as him (or at a time) that didn't play self. Maybe Dustin Hoffman in the season 5 finale, but I've always saw that as a joke since he was playing an angel/guide. Honestly, and down vote me if you will, but I felt that was a waste for him to play someone else on a show like Curb. He was already established actor with Emmys. I guess it was a good performance, but I felt like anyone else could've played him. It's not like Friends where guest stars like Bruce Willis or Julia Roberts get to play someone else because people want to see them. Plus, it isn't a show based on entertainment unlike that of Curb.

Then they were others like Nick Offerman, Lauren Graham, and America Ferrera. Then they were people well known  at least at a time or B-listers like Ed Begley Jr., Elizabeth Perkins, and Steven Weber. I also recognize people like Casey Wilson, Damon Waynes Jr., Nasim Pedrad, and Carrie Brownstein but they aren't well known enough to play themselves.

Of course, they did had guest stars that played themselves like Lin Manuel, F. Murray, Jimmy Kimmel, Elizabeth Banks, and of course, Salmon Rushdie.

209,Did anyone else notice that this is the first time since season 2 that the season finale episode couldn't easily double as the series finale?,"I feel like ever since Season 3, the show has purposely ended so that, if they stopped making episodes, the show would have a satisfying ending.

S3 - Larry opens a successful restaurant

S4 - Larry becomes a Broadway star

S5 - Larry donates his kidney and finds out the truth about his parents

S6 - Larry and Loretta live happily ever after

S7 - Larry puts on a successful Seinfeld reunion and he and Cheryl reconcile

S8 - Larry and Leon end up in France

The ending of S9, by contrast, doesn't offer the same type of satisfying bow on the series. It's a good ending (the finale was probably my favorite episode of the season) but in it, Larry's musical fails, and the last shot is just him running away from a Muslim guy (I don't think the insinuation is that Larry is assassinated). Overall, his life hasn't changed much due to the events of the episode, and the ending doesn't show his life on a potential new trajectory like past seasons have.

219,Would you have demanded the jacket back?,"I love to deeply think about ""what would I have done"" in certain Larry-situations. Latest example: the jacket-incedent from ""The Korean Bookie"". 
So, would you have said something? Would you have demanded the jacket back? 

Points for consideration:

Taking it back: 

- her husband to be had/has been stealing your news paper
- when being confronted, she didn't make a move to return the jacket at first, plus she was extremely unapologetic
- not only had she been unapologetic, she also acted as if grabing other's posessions from their cars wihtout asking was a normal and perfectly acceptable thing to do 
- she a between-the-lines-type of approach to let Larry know that it was the day of her engagement and that this should be enough for Larry to let her keep the jacket
- her genereal facial expression when she is near Larry

Letting her keep it:

- she just announced her engagement
- courtesy 
- chances are that other people would look down on me for not being nice enough/man enough/relaxed enough about the whole thing 
- uhmm...I really do not see many more points in favour of letting her keep the jacket


I am pretty sure I wouldn't have said something because of what others might have thought of me. But then again, Larry is the hero we don't deserve...or...deserve...or whatever.

50,[SPOILERS] Has anyone seen the first episode of the latest Curb Your Enthusiasm Season ? What did you think about it?,"I loved seeing all the characters in it, and I think they tried to get everyone in this episode, except I noticed that some were missing, (i.e. Wanda Sykes).

I felt like some things were unnecessary.

The opening the door dispute and bride/groom dispute with the lesbians seemed to go nowhere, and when she came looking for him in the restaurant, that didn't seem necessary.
The Richard Lewis Parakeet thing also seemed unnecessary but it's great Larry found a way of including Richard in the episode. Their dynamic is one of my favorites, because Richard doesn't let Larry get away with anything, yet they still joke around and are good friends.

I also like the foisting of Larry's assistant by him onto Suzie. I was hoping I'd get to see Suzie and her interact more, and her realize that Larry did that, in a whole scene by itself. I feel like that could have replaced the bride/groom scene, although I thought the haircut overcharging of Larry was funny, and of course it supplied a lot of bald jokes.

The main Fatwa situation and Leon's mistake that led Larry to get Fatwa'd was awesome, and I loved seeing Jimmy Kimmel, and that they had a segment within the show.
I hope Leon stays as Larry's assistant, that will be comedy gold.

I guess all in all I felt like the show was great because it introduced an excellent idea in the Fatwa of Larry, and because it included almost all the characters, even mentioning Sammy.

But on the other hand because it tried to include so much and have so many storylines, some of the storylines were weak and ended going nowhere, and it might have been better to give more time to some of the characters, and less time to some of the others that didn't seem necessary to the story.",curb,1508485690,historyinthe,5,1,True,2017-10-20

Those 2 were close calls and I am SO GLAD I lived through it to watch yet another season of Curb Your Enthusiasm 9. 

This show really helped me get through some of the tough time, depression I had growing up and I am at a better place now and I was praying Larry would make another season as I only started watching all of them when they were done.

This new season does not even look like they missed a beat or they had a major gap in between seasons. It just feels like yesterday and how does he do it??? The show just continues like there was no time gap. I read online about some news media complaining about political correctness etc, jesus get a life already. This new season is just brilliant just like the others (Sedar was my absolute favourite out of all)

54,Really really enjoying this season so far.,"Season nine is, in my opinion, Larry David's best work. Ever. 
It is just pure, undiluted Larry in its finest form.

The neurosis, the fatwa, the stubornness, it's just perfect. I was a little skeptical about this season, for me season 2 was always the best season and the show just never got on that level again. Ok, I still watched it all, so that's surely a testament to its quality. But it had become something I put on in the background whilst doing the dishes or ironing, it got maybe a light snicker every so often. 

Not this season. This season has made me laugh more than anything else currently on TV, and we're only on episode three?! 

I just love the guy's world, that's what being a multimillionaire must be like for the guy, you're so comfortable the lightness of your beep becomes a real thing in your life. Hysterical.

Also love the way all the storylines intertwine, you used to be able to predict that something or someone he had a problem with at the start of the episode would comz back to haunt him in 15min and that's still the case but it just happens much more organically!

When he struggles in the bathroom, it appears he simply unzips without unbuttoning his pants, expecting to pee from the zipper hole. Why wouldn't he just unbutton his pants entirely to make peeing as easy as possible? Unbuttoning, like I and I imagine most men do, would solve the entire conundrum. I thought the joke was hilarious but I'm confused by the thought process. Also, I seem to recall Larry having a problem with the NoFlyZone guy Cheryl dated previously. He doesn't like the idea of pulling down his underwear to pee, though that's what I thought most of society did. Any suggestions and insight is very welcome.",curb,1508794138,Avenger3611,7,2,True,2017-10-23

75,I Dunno About Y'all But Episode 4 Was The First Time I Laughed Out Loud All Season. SPOILERS!!,"Every single episode so far as seem so forced, so fake, like Larry is purposefully trying to be a dick.

This episode was different, it took awhile to notice it, but I could sense some throw back Curb type tropes, i.e. making note of somewhat common, albeit obscure social cues, i.e. Larry marking on Dr. Templeton's checking of the time during a therapy session, Larry's interactions, particularly snarky ones with Cheryl regarding their respective interactions with Dr. Templeton.

I loved Susie's action of buying the house from that super hot realtor and the look she gave him.  Oh my God, that sound that Jeff made when Susie asked, ""You like this bed Jeff?""

"".......""

78,Has anyone else seen issues with the editing in this season (I'm not sure exactly how to put it)?,"Let me start by saying that Curb Your Enthusiasm is not ordinarily available where I currently live, so the only way for me to view it is via online streaming. I feel like that may have somehow affected what I'm seeing, because there are issues that I haven't seen anyone else mention.

Basically, this season (or at least the streamed episodes I have watched) seems to have been edited really poorly. For example:

- Audio cutting off when the angle changes

- Phone/computer screens being very poorly superimposed

- In the court scene of episode three, one of the judge's pieces of dialogue was very obviously stitched together from different takes

- In episode four, at the start of the second scene with Dr Templeton, the establishing shot had a stock video watermark on it

I think the most likely case is that the shitty streams I'm watching have, for some reason, been edited by someone other than the people who make the show. Someone definitely would have mentioned it otherwise. Unfortunately I have no way to view the show through proper means, so it's the best I have.

83,Is it just me or Larry has a permanent smirk on his face this season?,"I'm enjoying this season so far and curiously a lot of early criticism seemed to dismiss/forget absurd stuff that happened a lot before since it's been so long.

I've been rewatching Curb a lot while waiting for the new season, and I continued to do so between new episodes.

One thing that strikes me as very different now is Larry's acting. It seems every time he's doing something obnoxious, or crazy, especially when he's being overly preoccupied with everyday stuff, he has this smirk on his face. 

It gives me the impression of ""yeah, I know I'm being cute, that's my thing"". He always did that face in interviews etc, as if saying, ""I'm joking, I'm not REALLY like show Larry"".

But it's weird to see show Larry doing that. Since he's doing that in ""real life"", he comes out as a true asshole and not someone who is just socially awkward.

I couldn't be happier that President Bush has stood up for having served in the National Guard, because I can finally put an end to all those who questioned my motives for enlisting in the Army Reserve at the height of the Vietnam War. I can't tell you how many people thought I had signed up just to avoid going to Vietnam. Nothing could be further from the truth.
...
Even though the National Guard and Army Reserve see combat today, it rankles me that people assume it was some kind of waltz in the park back then. If only. Once a month, for an entire weekend--I'm talking eight hours Saturday and Sunday--we would meet in a dank, cold airplane hangar. The temperature in that hangar would sometimes get down to 40 degrees, and very often I had to put on long underwear, which was so restrictive I suffered from an acute vascular disorder for days afterward. Our captain was a strict disciplinarian who wouldn't think twice about not letting us wear sneakers or breaking up a poker game if he was in ill humor...In the summer we would go away to camp for two weeks. It felt more like three. I wondered if I'd ever see my parakeet again. We slept on cots and ate in the International House of Pancakes. I learned the first night that IHOP's not the place to order fish.
...
[T]hanks to President Bush, I can stand up proudly alongside him and all the other guys who guarded the home front. Finally, we no longer have to be embarrassed about our contribution during those very trying years. ",curb,1509204326,es_price,1,2,True,2017-10-28

188,[Discussion] Has Curb Jumped the Shark?,"Curb is one of my favourite sitcoms of all time, if not my favourite. And I've been watching and mostly enjoying season 9 so far, but I can't help but feel that the show has jumped the shark.

To me, Curb was always that one sitcom that was based partially in reality. With realistic and believable storylines that didn't deviate far from reality. But season 9 is entirely different and has taken a path straight in to the absurd. Really, a security guard that's angry at Larry David and decides to fire real cannonballs at him at a Civil War reenactment? It doesn't feel like the same show anymore.

It also feels as though the show has way more jokes that just miss the mark than previous seasons, such as: the pickle jar, the reset button, thank you for your service, funkhouser's nephew. But the show has had some golden moments aswell such as Buck Dancer, Salman Rushdie(Aka Hugh Jackman) and plenty others I can't remember right now. Richard Lewis and J. B.

I don't want to mention a certain generation, but I think its time this generation deals with the reality that human behaviour, which has been the same bar a few changes in the last 50 years, won't change for them now or anytime in the near future.

And as humans, we need comedy, we need people like LD to put a mirror up to our faces so we can laugh at how absurd we humans can be.

I seriously don't want to live in a world were i have to supresss my true feelings be fake for the sake of not offending anyone. Nor do i want to live in a humourless world where jokes are just contained to ""ironic situations"" and poking fun at white males.

I just knew Curb would piss off this movement, let alone the morons who sit on twitter all day looking for any small thing to signal and be offended.

Its just so sad we have reached this point in less than half a decade. I mean look back at s8 and the themes would seriously piss off most of the SJW movement these days. And s8 was like what, 7 years ago?

Like that tweet from a few days, wait until they find out larry taugh an 8-year-old to draw a swastika. Or ""she has a rash on her pussy"" episode.

22,Trying to introduce Curb Your Enthusiasm to my picky dad - what's a good episode to begin with?,"Curb fans,

When I finished watching the entirety of Seinfeld a few years ago I started watching its spiritual sequel Curb Your Enthusiasm starting with the 60 minute long HBO special. It took a few seasons before I started enjoying the 30 minute non-laugh track episodes coming from Seinfeld's 22 minutes with laugh-tracks. However, CYE really grew on me and I now find it to be an amazing show (however, I still find Seinfeld funnier and to have more rewatchability value).

My dad is also a big Seinfeld fan, but have never seen an episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm - and I don't even think he knows who Larry David is. He's very picky about his entertainment, and quickly dismisses shows he doesn't like immediately.

With all this in mind, what do y'all think would be a good episode for me to show him as an introduction to Curb Your Enthusiasm?

Maybe Larry (the character)'s been working on Curb (the fake show on the show) during the six year interval, and is now dealing with the fallout. You know, using his friends' names (like he does) and real situations (like he does).

61,Was anyone else underwhelmed with the beginning of the season?,"I wanted to get general opinions on what everyone thought of the first episode (and potentially if you saw the leaked 3 additional episodes) to see if I'm being a little too hard on Season 9. 

I, as the majority of you here, am a HUGE Curb Your Enthusiasm and believe it is hands down the best show ever made. The first 8 seasons were absolutely gold and I still watch them to this day. Naturally, I would hold this season to the high standard that I hold the previous seasons to.

With season 9, however, I felt like the first episode (along with the leaked episodes) were very, very weak in terms of what Curb Your Enthusiasm would usually deliver. Everything just didn't seem to flow naturally and a lot of the plot/humour felt incredibly forced. What made it all worse was that the acting at times (in my opinion) got pretty bad, especially with Jeff and Suzie. Leon lacked his general enthusiasm at times and I could imagine how the Leon of 6 years ago would have delivered some of his lines. 

Now, it could be possible that because episodes 2-4 were leaked that they were just the rough drafts of the episode and not the final versions, because you can tell at times it seemed as if the actors would almost forget and would stumble on their lines. As an editor, I know how different a rough cut can be from a final cut, so I'm hoping this is the case. It definitely felt like the [leaked] episodes started to pick up from episode 1, but not to a significant degree.

I just wanted to hear everyones thoughts who saw episode 1 and potentially the leaked ones. I don't want anyone to think I'm 'hating' or anything on the show because I'm a huge fan, however, I feel that just because it's Curb Your Enthusiasm, it's going to hold a lot of bias from critics. I feel as if Season 9 so far shows glimpses of what this show was but won't be able to carry on the legacy it had.",curb,1506952631,the-radicalz,25,3,True,2017-10-02
63,How do you feel about the different look/increased production value of season 9,"Curb has always been a show looking kind of cheaply produced (I assumed this was intentìonal especially due to the original episode being a mockumentary). Use of hand cameras and the lack of professional/high class cinematographic elements has been part of Curb.

This seems to have ended with the start of season 9. The first few seconds alone were kind of a shocker with the american beauty-like shots of the neighbourhood. Also, Larry walking is not anymore captured with hand cams or steady cams but rather high end rail cameras or comparable equipment.

I do not know yet what to think of this but my fear is that it could reduce the charme of the show and distance the viewer from the situations in which they have felt so involved due to the immediacy of the shooting technique.

I watched seasons 1-8 of curb several years ago and I have a memory of a certain scene.  But my husband and I just rewatched the series and the scene never appeared.  Is this a curb scene or am I remembering a different show? 

The scene in my head is as follows:
Larry and a person (I believe a woman) are sitting in a public place chatting.  Larry looks across the room and sees two men kissing.  Larry makes a ""grossed out"" face.  The woman criticizes Larry for being homophobic because he wouldn't make the face if it was a man and a woman kissing.  He goes on to tell her that he is not homophobic, it's just that he cannot visualize himself in the shoes of either person since it is two men and therefore, he was grossed out.

We will be making official (stickied) discussion threads both before, during and after the S9 premiere, so be on the lookout for those.

Larry does allow it, but he remains begrudging, resentful, and deeply unsettled by not just having the tree there but the mere idea of getting one.

Larry takes job driving for Uber.

  First passenger he picks up is coming from a pride parade and is covered in glitter.  Larry drops him off at his apartment, but then realizes that his backseat where the man was sitting is covered in glitter. 

Larry is pissed and goes to car wash to vacuum car. (Losing time) Then he rushes back out to Uber more.  

Later in the day, he gets a notification from the area of the pride parade.  Larry sees his rider in the distance waving at his car (he is also covered in glitter). Larry tries to pretend he doesn't see man and tries to drive off. 

Larry drives into barricaded area and is stopped and confronted by the man in glitter.

Man in glitter: ""you saw me, why wouldn't you give me a ride?"" 

Larry: ""It's not that your gay, it's the glitter.  It makes a mess""

- When he realized he was there at the doctor's before the woman despite her appointment being a half hour later than his. However, he complains because he got there first yet she comes after him because they took his suggestion.

- Again at another doctor's, he complained about the signing sheet being private and like the previous one, they took his suggestion. However, he complains because she finds a hot woman there.

- When he complained that the doctor took a drink without asking yet when he went to Funkahouser's to visit his sister, he takes food out. She revealed and even the doctor admits how hypocritical it was. Of course, no one bought it later but still. 

- When he paid the orthodox jew/head of Kidney company for ""accidentally"" hitting a bump and complains instead of paying for the car, he paid for his daughter's ""things"". However, when the fiance/bride ""ruined"" his jacket and gave her money for the jacket, but pays it for the bookie instead.

13,Everyone else is the problem. Discuss.,"I've recently begun to watch Curb again from the beginning. Reddit wasn't a thing when I started the first time but there has always been one over-arching thought in my head whilst watching it Curb, which I feel the need to get off my chest...

Larry is not the problem - everyone else is! 

Seriously, I don't know whether it's an indictment of my own personality (part of CYE's appeal is that I can often identify with LD) but I find myself more often than not completely empathising with Larry and becoming furious with the characters opposing him!

This was so apparent in the episodes in season 1 I watched last night that it became frustrating. Obviously there is Cheryl's continuously unreasonable attitude (eg. petulantly causing an argument just because LD didn't shower her in attention when she comes home), but the melodrama of some of the other characters often borders on the ridiculous for me. Some examples here from episodes I saw yesterday:

* LD asks restaurant manager to unblock LD's car but manager refuses because his own waiter didn't pass on LD's 30% tip. WTF.

* Gil's wife goes complete flipmode because Larry hasn't taken his shoes off (yet is fine that Gil discusses his porn career at dinner???).

* Golf man holds a really unnecessary grudge because LD didn't pick up his golf ball. PICK YOUR OWN FLIPPIN BALL UP!

* Woman in cinema refuses to stand up to let LD walk past. And then accuses him of looking at her norks. Who TF does this!?

* Batshit old woman tears up LD's driving route instructions despite LD being incredibly patient. (I'd have lost my shit personally).

Does anyone else become quite emotionally invested in how other characters treat Larry!? I find it hard to imagine anyone being accepting if on the receiving end in those examples.

First of all, I know I'm preaching to the choir but I totally love the show. I had never seen it before (not an American) and I binge-watched the whole thing over the course of last month.  It's definitely great from the first to the (hopefully not) last season.

That said, I found the last episode of the fifth season (when LD gives undergoes the kidney transplant) quite clashing with the overall theme of the series. While in almost every episode we see the bad aspects of LD (complete lack of tact and self-control, cheapness, selfishness and generally obnoxious nature) we also see that he does in fact spend most of his time doling out apologies and trying to make his wife happy. And we also know that while people in his life despise his attitude [1] they also see something in him that they like, especially Cheryl.

In that episode though, after he temporarily dies, no one cares about him being dead, but instead they all start fighting over his money, which is very contrasting with what happens in any other episode.

What do you think?

[1] btw, one of the most hilarious things in the show is how he keeps mistreating his ""friends"" and how they keep popping up in various episodes like nothing happened.

I just found this to be a totally different way of portraying a protagonist in a series, where most shows protagonists are characters people aspire to be who always get the girl and has the clever comeback line.

18,Why does Larry's character change,"I'm watching through the series for the first time. I'm currently on season 8. But watching it I noticed around halfway through season 6 and onward, Larry goes from an idiot who doesn't have social skills to a massive jerk off. He yells at kids, straight up tells people to shut the fuck up, ditches his cancer ridden girlfriend, and a lot of other stuff. Is this on purpose? Is the point of the show now to make Larry unlikable? The transition from idiot to asshole felt really jarring. ",curb,1421795603,Charlescampion,20,11,True,2015-01-20

8,Richard Lewis is the embodiment of Larry David's depression (xpost from /r/fantheories),"First the general stuff.  He always wears black.  They have known each other for about 40 years which puts Larry in his 20's.  That age group is the most common age for the onset of depression.  They tend to also be somewhat opposites in terms of circumstance.  When one is doing well, the other is doing badly.  For example, one forgets lunch one day, while the other forgets the next day.  

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-5JngGHp5s

Now for some more specific examples.  First of all, Richard Lewis was almost seen only with Larry David (in terms of main characters) prior to his ""kidney transplant"".  He is talked about by the main characters in passing, but isn't seen.  The one scene is when he is revealed to Cheryl is after Larry has completely failed Cheryl the entire night.  He forgot to get her skin medication, lost her prescription and had made a fool of himself earlier in the day.  His depression was revealed to his wife for a short time:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJwW0YyWxU4

The kidney transplant can be seen as a suicide attempt.  Leading up to it, Larry is weighing whether or not to actually go through with it.  He makes his peace with God by connecting with his (fake) Christian parents, and is ready to die.  After the transplant,  Richard ends up doing great, relaxing on a beach, while Larry is on his deathbed.  Larry finally reaches possible happiness in Heaven, but is promptly kicked out, leading to his depression growing worse, and Richard Lewis interacting with the show's main characters on a regular basis.

Finally, I'd like to point you guys to this scene in which Larry states that Richard is the one who would drive him to suicide.

* The 'stare down' Larry has whenever he thinks he is being lied to. Usually followed by a little bit of oboe.
