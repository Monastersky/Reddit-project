One theme I've caught on to in the series is the use of the telephone. It's often the punchline of the joke (Vandalay Industries; the Chinese deliveryman talking to the hair restoration place; Elaine's mystery message, etc), or central to the plot in some way.

194,George's new toilet.,"Thought I'd share something i wrote when i, myself, got a new toilet....

-----
George walks into Jerry's apartment.

George: Jerry, you're not going to believe what's happened! It's possibly the greatest moment in my life!

Jerry doesnt look up from his comic book.

Jerry: Hair plugs are covered under your new work's insurance?

George:  You can't crush my excitement.  I have been given the most glorious gift of a new toilet!

George throws his arms up in the air, smiling big and wide.

Jerry:  A new toilet?  

George: Can you imagine, Jerry!?  I've never had this experience before.  For once, no one has EVER used that toilet besides me.  

Jerry: Wow!  This is even better than your private toilet at the job where you pretended to be handicapped!

George chuckles.

George: I know!  I'm actually thinking of buying a lock for the door and keeping the key around my neck at all times.

Jerry: Isn't that a little excessive?

George snorts. 

George: Jerry, you don't understand, my friend.  You simpleton, who hast never been bestowed a virgin porcelain, will never understand.

 

-----

 

George's parents are stopping by to pick up George before a big dinner.  Frank claps.

Frank: All right George, you need to hurry up!  If we're ten seconds past the early bird special we have to pay full price!

Estel: Frank, quit being so cheap!  You know this is Georgie's special day.

Estel smiles real big.  

George, from the other room: Ma, it's not that special of a day.

Estel: Well, of course it is!  You've kept your job for three months.

Frank: We shouldn't be celebrating, we should be punishing him!  Why would we applaud such a meager accomplishment?  And can you HURRY UP THE CLOCK IS TICKING!

Estel: Well, actually, I need to use the restroom real quick.

Estel starts walking towards the bathroom.  George drops something and runs out to the living room

George: WHAT? Hahaaa, what?  Ma, you dont have to use the bathroom.

Estel frowns as George smiles and blocks the way.

Estel: Yes I do, Georgie. Now let me through to your bathroom.

George holds her back abruptly.

George:  But, but we REALLY need to GO!  We'll miss the early bird special!

Frank: He's right.  You can hold it.

Estel: George, let me go.  

George: Now, come on, we really have to get going and the bathroom at the rest--

Estel: George, i don't feel very well.  I need to use your bathroom.

George: Yeah, but we really –

Estel: GEORGE, LET ME USE YOUR BATHROOM!

Frank: Will you LET YOUR MOTHER USE THE BATHROOM ALREADY!? WE'RE GOING TO MISS THE SPECIALS!

George flusters and starts screaming.

George: ALL RIGHT! ALL RIGHT! SHE CAN USE THE BATHROOM! ...But only if you answer a simple question first.

Estel &amp; Frank: What?

George stiffens up and licks his lips.

George: Number one or number two?

Estel: George!

Estel tries to push by, but George holds her back.

George: Number one, or two?

Estel: GEORGE.

Frank: For GOD’S SAKE MAN!  Move out of your mother’s way!  THINK of the SPECIAL!

Estel pushes by George in a hurry and slams the door.

George: ONE OR TWO!?  ONE OR TWO!?

Estel starts moaning.  George crumples to the floor.

George: And there it goes!  There it goes.  It's ruined.  

Estel, inside the bathroom: Frank, we're going to be here awhile.

George: NOOO!!!

Frank: I'll meet you there.  I'm NOT MISSING the SPECIAL!!!!

221,"When Jerry tells the joke about being shot out of a cannon instead of taking a flight, he tells the joke from the orientation of California, instead of New York.","I know the show was filmed in Los Angeles, but it takes place in New York, and presumably, the stand-up scenes also take place in New York.

In Season 2, Episode 12, he tells a joke about missing a plane, and being shot out of a cannon. As the cannon operator, Jerry first rotates to his left saying ""Chicago"". This first rotation is not important. But then he says ""Oh, Dallas"", and he rotates to his right. Dallas is south of Chicago, so if Jerry was in New York, which is east of both aforementioned cities, he should have rotated to his left again, which would simulate a pivot from north to south from the position of New York. But the way he actually does it indicates he is west of both cities, which means he was thinking about his position in Los Angeles.

I think the worst offender in many ways is Jerry but I don't consider him to be bad guy. 

So of the main cast; Jerry, Kramer, Elaine and George which would you date? 

I think Kramer would be the worst because whilst I do think he is well meaning his flightiness and his lack of awareness would annoy me.  I doubt you could really rely on him to do anything for you and he would not be entirely trust worthy, not in a horrible way, more that he just wouldn't realise how he was behaving.",seinfeld,1555309214,endangeredpenguin,9,3,True,2019-04-15

307,Where are they now?,"There seems to be an idea in the minds of certain members of the cast that something called ""The Seinfeld Curse"" is a real thing, I can only assumed that the cast could never get bigger or that they are typecast and so will never be taken seriously. So where are they now and where would you like them to be?

Jerry is still doing the occasional stand up and from what I have heard (I don't follow Pop Culture so I don't know if this is for real) he is a grumpy old man who seems to resent people getting into comedy and if you look him up on IMDB he actually seems to have done very little but this could just be that he doesn't see himself as an actor. That he is a comedian first and an actor second.

Michael is likely to be remembered for the racist outburst than anything else these days and honestly I am not sure it should be forgotten. He seems to have done a bit more than Jerry but not much more. I enjoyed him in Seinfeld but I don't know if he has much range. With that being said I haven't seen anything else with him so it is hard to judge,

Julia seems to have done mostly TV work with the occasional film but the only film I know her from is Enough Said staring alongside James Gandolfini in what I feel is a very underrated film about relationships in middle age. She was very strong in this but I still couldn't shake her from being Elaine.

Jason seems to have had by far the best career, whilst I have not seen him in anything other than Seinfeld he does seem to have had a lot of TV time and even some films - though from what I have heard he was a big deal on the stage before joining the cast.

So I guess I need to go back the original question; where are they now and where would you like them to be? Do you think the ""Seinfeld Curse"" is a real thing? It is possible that they carved the niche in Seinfeld and would never be thought of in any other way or is that they are simply not great actors? I would like to think of all four actors having good careers and I wish them well. I just worry this is not the case.

They are all planning on going to university in America this autumn.

Anyway, I want to convert them to Seinfeld fans, or at least people who appreciate Seinfeld, but they're resistant to the idea, because *I* watch Seinfeld and I'm old, apparently (27).  I've convinced them to let me show them an episode of Seinfeld in class (I'm the teacher, so I guess I can do what I want).  But I'm not sure what episode to pick.

It can't be an episode with too many dated cultural references (dingo ate your baby, the JFK parody), nor should it rely too much on old technology for gags (fax machines, etc.).  Too much intertextual narrative is bad, too (I can't show The Foundation because they don't know who Susan—Lily—was). The episode has to be accessible to all audiences, and relatively appropriate (so The Package, and The Contest are out).  My students all speak English fairly well, but we will need to watch the episode with subtitles.  And of course whatever episode should be riotously funny.

159,"Just finished series, Seinfeld Finale seemed totally appropriate","Apologies if this is a viewpoint that's annoyingly common topic around here. I've just finished the show start to finish, having seen most of it in parts just from when it was on TV a lot growing up. Mostly enjoyed it then, mostly enjoyed it now. Some stuff hasn't aged so well but a lot of that became funny in it's own way and as an interesting relic of the times. 

I really enjoyed the finale but remember it being hated and controversial. I googled it to see if folks had come around on it in the time since, but from the looks of things it still runs many folks the wrong way. Even some involved in the production have turned their backs on it to some degree, which is pretty surprising to me. 

Even worse are the reasons and expectations that lead to that negative reception. Some of it is really absurd, it seems like many people not only had the bizarre wish to see Jerry and Elaine end up together, but actually expected it to happen in the show. For one thing, they literally tried that more than once and it was clear it wasn't a romantic relationship success. It's also not like there was always some ""will they won't they"" or any insinuation they longed to be together, despite it being obvious they had a healthier relationship as just friends. We get seasons of that, so no idea where anyone gets off shipping them together so seriously. 

Other than it was just a bunch of other random unmet expectations, from the sampling I read it didn't seem like anyone actually had any sensible ideas for a conclusion anyway. Like, if it just ended with them getting the Seinfeld show and everyone happily ever after would not be funny and not be satisfying. 

Seinfeld is a show like It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, Friends, or Curb Your Enthusiasm. They are all funny shows about groups of terrible people who enable one another and the comedy comes from seeing these abhorrent people try and fail to participate in society among regular people. There are definitely times where you empathize with the characters anyway, but part of the fun of shows about bad people is the enjoyment of when they get their comeuppance. It's cathartic seeing them have to eat their shit salads, you don't have to feel bad for them, you feel bad for the normal folks they brought ruin to with their amusing but selfish antics. 

The Seinfeld Finale works so well because it finally brings all of that built up tension to a head and pops it. For 9 seasons we don't really see anyone face real consequences for their actions, even Jerry points out that eating cereal with less milk than usual is the hardest thing he has ever had to deal with. None of the gang even seem to think they'll ever have to answer for their actions, let alone feel remorse for any of it. 

They're totally unrepetant, and it was great to seem all sitting in a cell for it.

I don't think it was a perfect finale, there was a bit too much clip shoe action, especially coming right after an actual clip show. I also think it would have been better for the last shot to have just been the four of them in the cell having a typical coffeeshop conversation. Would end on a traditional beat, but with a funnier context since they're all about to go to prison yet still remain the same sorts of selfish people. 

For those who are still disappointed with it to the day, would you mind explaining why? And if you're also a fan of Always Sunny, do you likewise have similar expectations for a finale given the similarities?",seinfeld,1552433801,Khanstant,4,5,True,2019-03-12

55,The Costanza effect,"There are two very particular ways that I feel like George on a regular basis, other than being cheap...

One, I constantly order the wrong meal at restaurants. I am always torn between the meal that sounds best to me and is obvious that I will enjoy or the meal that sounds interesting but is outside my normal wheelhouse. I constantly talk myself into picking the second choice and always regret it. Of course I never remember this annoying habit until after the meal. Most recent example, my wife and I (great way to start a story, btw) went to a popular breakfast place for the first time that is know for their eggs Benedict (my favorite breakfast) and their quiche (which I have never been a fan of). I tell myself that eggs Benedict can’t really be improved upon but perhaps a great quiche can open my eyes to a new world. Well, the quiche was just okay (probably a great quiche but Then I don’t really like quiche). Now here I am three days later and I’m still kicking myself for passing up what could have been the greatest breakfast of all time, had I only stuck with what I know I love.  

Second, I ALWAYS get in the wrong line EVERYWHERE. Whether it’s a queue at Disney world, a toll lane, a supermarket checkout, fast food counter, etc, if there is a choice to be made as to which line to get in, the one I choose will invariably come to a standstill. Sometimes I will give up on a line and go to the one that is moving along well. That line will then come to a halt and the line I was previously in will start move incredibly fast. However, if I resist the urge to switch to another line and just wait my line out in hopes that it will speed up, it will not and I’ll slowly die as life passes me by.

Anyone else have similar experiences that feel like something George would deal with regularly? ",seinfeld,1549510374,danielrainey,3,1,True,2019-02-06

133,Where Do You Stand On The Finale,"Unlike many, I think Seinfeld was as strong in the later seasons as it was in the early seasons.

With that being said, I thought the finale was pretty underwhelming, and ended the show on a somewhat sour note.

It's probably the only episode where Kramer actually irritated me, with the shit on the plane.

Anyone think it was a strong note to finish on?

Personally I think the show could've kept going for another couple of seasons. I don't think the quality ever declined in the manner shows such as Frasier did. With the way Seinfeld was set up, I think it had a pretty foolproof formula for remaining strong, and it would've been interesting to see the dynamic evolve with the change of century.

I remember reading a spec script someone did for a post 9/11 Seinfeld and I was laughing my ass off at some of it.

325,Anyone else lose respect for Jason and Julia when..,"They kicked up a stink over not being written into an episode? Jason threatened to leave the show in a moment of pique if they were ever not included in an episode again.

On the one hand, yes, I would try and write them into every episode as I enjoy the characters and they are needed to balance out the show, but on the other Jason Alexander would've had a very mediocre career and would be a lot less wealthy if he left his golden goose. Julia, too, basically owes her career to Seinfeld and going by her acting abilities on the show and all the bloopers I've watched I'd hazard a guess that she would've struggled to get roles like Veep if it wasn't for the goodwill from Seinfeld.

Also, I've never heard Michael publicly complain about not being in episodes, and if I recall correctly there was at least one that featured Jerry, Jason and Julia but not him.

I've also lost count of the amount of episodes that go up to ten minutes without featuring Kramer, who almost appears to be an afterthought to the show's writing at points despite being the most popular character.

Anyone else have any thoughts on this? 

Don't get me wrong. I like George and Elaine, and I think Jason Alexander is a witty and charming guy, but hearing that anecdote and watching Jason on the inside looks I can't help but sense a little arrogance at certain points.

454,My love of Seinfeld nearly got me killed.,"This happened about 15 years ago. I was in high school and was helping my brother move out of his apartment. One of his friends who I had known for a long time was helping also. He was a huge guy who looked kind of scary but was always really funny and nice to me. He would tease me about being small and stuff, all in good fun. 

He had recently gotten married and had replaced his lifted Jeep with a really sad looking car. I gave him a hard time about how he really ""sold out"" now that he was married. He gave me crap for not having a girlfriend at the time and we went back and forth teasing each other. Figuring he was as familiar with Seinfeld as everyone I knew, I decided to drop a trump card on the increasing back and forth insults with, ""o yeah, well I had sex with your wife!"". 

His face turned bright red and he grabbed me around the throat and started to choke me. I couldn't explain because I couldn't breath. He was screaming about how disrespectful saying something like that was and what a piece of crap I was. My brother heard the commotion and literally pried his hands off my throat before I passed out. I tried to apologize profusely and  explain the context to him, but he was to angry to listen. 

Apparently he had an explosive temper and was known to snap for know reason. I wish I had known that at the time. He later had a stint in prison for assaulting someone else over an insult.

I see him once or twice a year at birthdays parties, etc. I still completely avoid him, or if forced to, talk to him in the most calm and pleasant way possible. I wonder if he ever did see the episode or understand the joke.",seinfeld,1550701883,Cravati,16,40,True,2019-02-20

Daniel von Bargen (RIP) plays Kruger of Kruger Industries in Seinfeld and plays Lieutenant Nilsen in Basic Instinct. 

Stephen Tobolowsky plays Tor on the episode “The Heart Attack” in Seinfeld and Dr. Lamott In Basic Instinct. 

Jack McGee plays Ralph on the episode “The Pothole” and plays the sheriff in Basic Instinct.

Bradford English plays the Cop in the episode “The Robbery” and plays the campus police officer in Basic Instinct. 

James Rebhorn (R.I.P.) played the D.A. On the episode “The Finale” and plays Dr. McElweine in Basic Instinct.  

I think that is it.

This is not a diss on Seinfeld or David, in fact I love Curb Your Enthusiasm,  but it's a very different tone.

I'm a little ambivalent about it, but I've been happy to see that I've more or less internalized it over the years, that's it's no longer ripping off Jerry's material; I can actually say in good conscience that I'm influenced by Seinfeld.

Requires Android 6.0 (Marshmallow) or above. 3mb download.

I updated it a couple of days ago to add 10 more clips, bringing the total to 35 clips.

It includes ""A Festivus For the Rest Of Us"" by George's Dad, which is my personal favourite.

&amp;#x200B;

How it works:

* When your phone rings, it selects a random clip from its embedded library
* Copies this selected clip into your ringtone media library
* So you need your phone to ring for it to work
* After the clip is copied it appears as an entry in the location - Android Settings &gt; Sounds &gt; Ringtone

I didn't really think about it too much though.

Years passed and I became more aware of it, saw clips on youtube, a million references on reddit, and I became more interested. A few months ago I found out I could watch it on Amazon Prime, and ended up diving into it from season 1. 

I'm not really that much of a TV watcher but somehow I ended up watching the whole run, 180 episodes. I found myself caught up in it, and of course found myself laughing and laughing so many times.

It wasn't planned that I would finish this run on Christmas day, it just ended up this way. I just finished the last episode, it's hard to draw a conclusion right now but it has been a great ride, I have enjoyed it so much.

If you're wondering why we didn't just do the Festivus episode or another holiday-centric episode of Seinfeld, we're staying true to our mantra and going in order with the show so we haven't gotten to any yet (we're about halfway through season three). Plus, How Murray Saved Christmas has a pretty decent Seinfeld connection.

Where is this intro. To wit:

George quit his real estate job partway through Season 2 and was unemployed in Season 3, however the S03E10 episode ""The Stranded"" has him still working at his real estate job. This is explained in the continuity as follows from Wikipedia: 

&gt;The episode was originally produced for the second season. However, Larry David, dissatisfied with the episode, had the episode shelved until midway through season three. Its initial broadcast included a special introduction by Jerry to explain the continuity error of George still working in the real estate business.

I've been a longtime fan of Seinfeld, and remember an episode of Seinfeld where they are filmed inside of a liquor store. On the background (I think behind Jerry) you can see a shelf with beer on it. I clearly remember this because there were a lot of Belgian special beers visible.

I'm asking this question because I work for a Belgian brewery which is the brewer of one of those beers, and I told this at work and people were really surprised because during the timespan of Seinfeld our export to the US was just in its start.

401,"Spec Script: The ""Almost""","Four principals are sitting in the coffee shop. Monk’s is hiking coffee and food prices from the next week. George talks with the waitress angrily about how 1 USD higher coffee price is 30% increase when Yankees gave him only 5% hike after a promotion. ""Can you believe it Jerry?"" Waitress says, ""Management decision"" and leaves. An irate George plans revenge. Jerry has found his favorite word in the dictionary. Almost. Almost late is just on time. Almost got killed is averting accident. So on. George casually says he loves the word as it is the combination of two of his favorite words - All and Most. Elaine says her favorite word is ""Few"". Kramer says, ""None"" (in a way it's not clear if it's his favorite word or he doesn't have a favorite).

Elaine looks for a new roommate as her previous boyfriend had stolen all her stuff and left. She is too afraid to live alone. She really likes the boyfriend of a roommate applicant and accepts her. Kramer cannot enjoy Bette Middlers shows anymore because of overwatching. ""I OVERWATCHED the show, Jerry, I OVERWATCHED it. If only I could UNWATCH it, I'd LOVE it again."" Newman suggests him to get ECT so that he can forget the show and watch it again as new. Newman has first hand experience and as an USPS employee, his health insurance fully covered his expenses.

Elaine’s roommate breaks up with her boyfriend. Elaine doesn’t like her anymore with the boyfriend gone with whom she was always flirting in the apartment. She gets into a fight with her roommate and finds out that the guy was depressed and was planning to start on ECT. Her roommate didn’t believe in the treatment and that’s the reason for the breakup. Jerry’s girlfriend-for-the-week starts telling a story, ""Have you heard that Tim Whatley's kid almost got cancer?"". Jerry asks, “Almost?” comically. The girlfriend smiles and nods. Jerry winks and says, “Go on” enthusiastically.

George is alone at Monk and looking at a very small notepad on what he can steal from Monk's. Sugar packets, napkins, makes up the entire list. Monk’s Cafe has removed sugar packets and the box of napkins from the table and only brings a few with each order. George asks the waiter to bring the management and argues with the Cafe owner how can they worsen the service and increase the price at the same time. ""No sugar. One more dollar!"" Cafe owner tells him that they had to increase price because ""all"" the customers misuse sugar packets and napkins (by taking more than required) and ""most"" people like him steal them from the table. The owner asks him how could Yankees increase the ticket prices so much if they haven't won in a while. A livid George steals salt packets from Monk’s while the owner is watching him.

Kramer and the depressed guy are waiting at the ECT center. George, Jerry reach the center to dissuade Kramer. Elaine is there to be supportive to the depressed guy who is still unsure whether he wants ECT. She bad mouths about her roommate and convinces him to undergo ECT (hoping he'd forget her roommate and fall in love with her). ""Few had any adverse result because of ECT"", the doctor says. Elaine screams and throws her hands in the air, ""Few-few-few"".

George is carrying the stolen salt packets which he has no use of.  Still irate George mutters angrily, ""All-Most-All-Most"" and opens each salt packet and pours the content in a trash-can-looking bin where the mouth guards for ECTs are kept. The salt now laces the mouth guards.

Both ECT sessions are over. Because of salted mouth guards, the brain had become more conductive to electricity than usual. The depressed guy is alive, but his brain is fried. The entire medical staff is worried about Kramer's conditions after the fiasco with the depressed guy. Kramer had licked off all the salt before ECT and says, ""Are these pretzel-flavored? Because you know, these pretzels are making me thirsty"", while removing his mouth guard. The doctors start examining him even more worried. Kramer does one of his jerks and tics “eeh-eeh-eeh-eeh-eeh” on touch. He says he remembers all Bette Middlers films and shows even more vividly.

Jerry observes Kramer closely and tells the staff that Kramer's behavior is almost perfectly normal and realizes that almost is not always the best word. Especially when placed right before positive ideas. Almost on time, almost won the lottery, almost tall etc. All four goes to Elaine’s apartment with the depressed guy. The roommate has stolen all her new stuff because of spite and left. Elaine looks at the guy and says dejectedly, ""FEW are worth the trouble."" Kramer says, ""None"". Jerry looks around the empty apartment and says, ""ALMOST"" in a very loud and frustrated way.

In the closing sequence, Jerry is talking about the downside of “almost”. Almost funny, almost great, almost natural. So on. Not his favorite word anymore.",seinfeld,1543436122,sb584012,0,1,True,2018-11-28

408,Why does the group uses very formal name etiquette with superiors/elders?,"On repeat viewings, it's clear that the group (aside from Jerry) consistently and independently use formal etiquette in addressing or referencing their superiors. There are multiple examples - Mr. Morgan, Mr. Wilhelm, Ms. Landis, Mr. Pitt, Mr. Peterman... They also do this with non-work people too - Mrs. Allister, Mrs. Zanfino, Mr. Papanicolas. 

I'm aware that this is the ""proper"" etiquette when addressing elders/superiors, but I'm curious if this was a specific writing quirk (perhaps to point out the irony of how they treat people vs. how they address them) or was this still commonplace in society in the 90s? Perhaps a Larry David-ism?

38,"I'm getting Seinfeld nostalgia, just needed someplace I could rant and hopefully people I could relate to...","I find this weird, but whenever I finish a show I always tend to do research on like the actors (I really obsess over these people, I watch as many interviews as I can featuring them and google their net worths, houses, social media, etc), behind the scenes footage, writers, directors, creators of the show, old magazine covers of them, Youtube vids of certain scenes. For example, before I had watched Seinfeld, I had just finished Friends, and thought that I had just experienced the best show ever and nothing could ever top it, mostly due to all the relationships I developed with the characters of the shows. I would go down my obsessive rabbit hole of watching several of their interviews, etc (all of the stuff I mentioned above about my obsessive routine). Well, I finished Seinfeld like maybe around late May, early June? And I have been doing all these obsessive routines from the time I finished Seinfeld up until now, and don't think I can stop LOL, I'd admit the routines I did a lot after I finished the show for maybe about a good month...then stopped, but recently this past month I've been doing it sooooo much like waaay too much like I shouldn't be continuing these obsessive routines now. I should be focused on just watching Big Bang Theory(on season 10 now), but I've been watching old standup routines Jerry Seinfeld did, old interviews he did on the Letterman show, all the Seinfeld Emmy awards, Comedian in Cars Getting Coffee(his work ethic was crazy and he was talented af), Michael Richards and his Laugh Factory Incident, Julia Louis Dreyfus's cancer experience, her instagram, how she's being involved in the political scene, how old shes getting now, but still putting on a crap ton of makeup and dying her hair(I saw how she looked like after her cancer treatment), also the Curb Your Enthusiasm episode where they did a fake reunion really brought back a crap ton of nostalgia, I wish that they did more scenes, or that it just lasted longer, I could care less about Larry watching his Tv with that blonde chick LOL(and yeah I know I'm not a true fan because I barely found out about this reunion like 3 weeks ago and started Seinfeld the summer of 2017 and barely finished last June of 2018, yeah...show was boring at first, and I didn't always watch so consistently...gonna rewatch it eventually(anyways...just needed to rant because this has never happened to me, where my obsessive routines would still continue this long, also recently I've been developing a crush on Julia Louis Dreyfus, don't get me wrong, I know most of us had crushes on Elaine the character, but I've been becoming more and more attracted to Julia Louis Dreyfus, I mean her personality and voice is just so attractive...I've even had a few dreams about her (nothing dirty). On a sidenote, I think it's weird how whenever I watch an old sitcom/show and start developing feelings for a female character, I realize I'm basically liking an old lady, which is kinda sick.

Amazon, which is the largest cloud provider, is notoriously secretive about the precise locations of its data centers. While a few are publicly tied to Amazon, this is the exception rather than the norm. More often, Amazon operates out of data centers owned by other companies with little indication that Amazon itself is based there too or runs its own data centers under less-identifiable subsidiaries such as VaData, Inc. In some cases, Amazon uses pseudonyms to obscure its presence. For example, at its IAD77 data center, the document states that “Amazon is known as ‘Vandalay[SIC] Industries’ on badges and all correspondence with building manager”.

I'm thinking of binge watching Seinfeld again from start to finish, and thought I could make it into a project where I rate every episode I watch so I can rank them from best to worst (least best :p). This has actually been on my mind for a while, but I've never bothered to do it. My plan is to set up some categories, and so after each episode I'll give each category a score from 1-10 (or 1-5, haven't decided yet), add up the scores and rate the episodes accordingly.

Just thought I could make a quick post here and ask for advice on what categories would be best to include. I'm thinking the likes of: 

- 'Humour': basically purely the funniest episodes. The ones that make me laugh the most.

- 'Story': although each episode has great storytelling, I feel like it is a necessity as a category.

Mr Visakis. now in Greek Vizi means breast and visaki means small breast which i can't believe they did this accidentally because it plays perfectly with that arc.,seinfeld,1533917111,DangerousGazelle,5,38,True,2018-08-10

100,How come Jerry and Elaine don’t stay together after “The Deal”?,"So, the plot for “The Deal” is that Jerry and Elaine are trying to come up with a set of rules to help them hook up but still remain good friends. Things eventuality go south like they usually do in these situations and they’re on the verge of breaking the deal and not being friends anymore. At the last second they work it out after Elaine says she wants “this, that and the other”. The next day We see Elaine coming out of Jerry’s room with the paper and Kramer asks them what they were doing to day, to which Elaine says “this and that” and Jerry says “and the other” and they have a cute little moment. Kramer says “boy I liked you two more before you were a couple” and that’s the end of the episode. 

The next episode is “The Baby Shower” (Red shirt!  Red shirt!) and Jerry and Elaine don’t seem like they’re dating and the episode after that is “The Chinese Restaurant” when Jerry says the famous line “well, we used to date but not anymore” but I always thought that was hinting at their relationship before we meet them. 

So, what happened?  Did they just abandon that story altogether or was that the way season 2 was supposed to end and they break up during the break?  It’s always seemed weird to me. ",seinfeld,1534251644,leejoness,13,8,True,2018-08-14

This was during a Mets-Phillies game.  I'm assuming that Kramer/Newman were cheering for the Mets, and it is indeed true that McDowell at one point pitched for the Phillies.  

BUT not until [1989](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_McDowell).  On the date of the game in question (June 14, 1987), McDowell was a Met.

&gt;What's funny about arguing about whether cucumbers should go on pizza? What's funny about people getting mad with each other over the abortion issue?

What's the likelihood of a family letting a stranger into their house to watch anything on TV?

&gt;The magic of Seinfeld is in humor in situations you can identify with. This is about as funny as a pony showing up in Jerry's apartment and starting to poop. It's so outside the realm of reality, it is dull and boring. With all the writers, this is the best they could do? Just being outraged about something is not funny by itself. Anyone could do that.

253,The Rich Vocabulary of Seinfeld,"I was born in the early 90s, and grew up watching Seinfeld with my parents. I'm sure many of you have a similar story. Seinfeld was THEIR show, what they turned to after every hard day to take a load off their minds before bed, and to which we all shared many a long gutteral laugh together as a family. As I grew older my appreciation for the show grew richer, and the rest is history. But lately I was thinking about how advanced some of the vocabulary in the show's dialogue must have been for me at a very young age. I know I didn't understand most of it, along with some of the more complicated situational social humor, but I remember as a kid some words sticking, either getting their meanings through context or eventually looking them up and incorporating them into regular use. So during my last lap around I made a note every time I noticed a word that was unusual, or ""advanced"" from the perspective of a basic fluent speaker of English. I surprised myself, there were many words I never  picked up even on the first 100 (I reckon) laps around. So anyway, here's my (incomplete) list. Are there any you can remember learning from the show, specifically? I remember in high school using the line ""I was merely speaking extemporaneously"" with friends SO MUCH, maybe more so because it made ME laugh.

343,The Seinfeld-Sopranos Connection,"Over the past several months I've been re-watching both Seinfeld and The Sopranos along with listening to Seincast and No F'n Ziti podcasts.(Shout out to Matt, Vinny, Evan, and Brendan)
I started to notice things in The Sopranos that reminded me of Seinfeld. I googled and found a Vulture article from 2014 touched on this connection. It focused on how both shows ushered in new eras of television, added greatly to the national lexicon, influenced pop culture that followed, changed how television looked and was shot, and had a similar message. ""No Hugging and No Learning"" from Seinfeld and ""People Don't Change"" as one of the main themes of The Sopranos. Jerry Seinfeld and his gang are the original anti heroes who set the stage for Tony and his horde of imitators. What the article leaves out is a lot of other similarities I'd like to document here. 

The Sopranos picked up right where Seinfeld left off. In May of 1998 Jerry Seinfeld left the air and on 1/10/1999 we first saw Tony Soprano take his iconic drive from New York to New Jersey. We left NY for NJ just as we were leaving the 20th century for the 21st. What Seinfeld was to 1990s U.S. culture, the Sopranos would be for the turn of the century/post 9/11 U.S. era. 

Even the names of the creators of both series go together sequentially, Larry David Chase. Both men appeared in their own shows multiple times and Larry David even shows up in the Sopranos when Uncle Junior mistakes a Curb Your Enthusiasm episode to be a show about him and Bobby Baccalieri. 

They also shared many themes. 
Let's start with the Seinfeld Finale. While in the court the prosecuting attorney says this about our favorite foursome. 

""They have quite a record of mocking and maligning. This is a history of selfishness, self absorption, immaturity, and greed. And you will see how everyone that comes into contact with these 4 individuals has been abused, wronged, deceived, and betrayed."" 

Sounds awfully similar to a certain North Jersey family, and ""this thing of ours"" in general. Chase shows us again and again anyone who touches the web of the Mafia is worse off.
Also in the Seinfeld finale the head of NBC is played by actor Peter Riegert who went on to play Councilman Ronald Zellman in The Sopranos. 

Addiction

Gambling: Davey Scatino and Kramer. 
Alcohol: 
Sopranos- Christopher, Murmur, Juliana Skiff

Seinfeld- Jason ""Stanky"" Hanke, Dick,Elaine's boyfriend from the Red Dot, Elaine's Dad, and even Elaine herself is a problem drinker. 

Heroin: Christopher, Julianna Skiff, J Peterman, Zach the co-worker Elaine makes out with at the holiday party. 

Germaphobes: Puddy, Peggy, Paulie, and Jerry. 
Paulie has a monologue about how shoelaces get wet with piss in restrooms, similar to how Jerry throws away a shoelace because it touched a restroom floor. 

Suicide

In Seinfeld: Martin(Jerry's neighbor), Guy at hospital that lands on George's car, Newman fakes suicidal tendencies in court to get out of a ticket.
Sopranos: Davy Scatino gets a potential suicide attempt interrupted (I'm fixing a fucking light!), AJ attempts it, Gloria Trillo, Vin Makazian, Eugene Pontecorvo.

Comas

In Seinfeld, Martin ends up in a coma after his suicide attempt, Kramer worries about his fate if he ends up comatose, and Reilly's wife in The Jerk Store is in a coma when George claims to have had sex with her. 
Sopranos: Tony and Christopher both had elaborate coma experiences. There are a lot of Hospital scenes in general in both shows.  

Use of Celebrities

In both shows the celebrities the gang encountered were usually worse off. Kramer stole Anthony Quinn's t shirt, fired Raquel Welch(although he didn't get away unscathed) scared Fred Savage, punched out Mickey Mantle and fought other Yankees at a fantasy camp,  stalked DiMaggio, scammed Jim Fowler, and attempted to take over the affairs of Bette Midler after she was hospitalized by one George Costanza. Only Jon Voigt left his meeting with Kramer better off.
George not only berated and injured Midler, he tried to scam a date from Marisa Tomei, attempted to use Keith Hernández to extend his unemployment, and made Danny Tartabull miss a telethon. 
Sopranos: Chris stalked and tried to shake down Sir Ben Kingsley, robs and punches Lauren Bacall(in a way that is eerily reminiscent of Jerry robbing Mabel Choate for her marble rye), scared Jon Favreau with his gun. (Favreau also appeared in Seinfeld in the episode The Fire as ""Eric the Clown"")

WWII

Many references in both shows. In Seinfeld you have mentions of Stalin,Hitler,Goebbels, The Soup Nazi, Mengele, Jerry and George pose as Neo Nazis, Mr. Pitt as Hitler. 
Sopranos: Tony is constantly watching WWII shows on The History Channel. In season 6 footage of Nazis marching through Paris is shown when Carmella announces she's going there.  

Mafia References in Seinfeld

Kramer as the Godfather in the episode The Bris. Later Kramer dates Connie who appears to be connected. He ends up in a sack in the East River. Jerry is accused of breaking Mike's thumbs and killing Suzie, talks to a godfather type named Mr Chichio in The Maestro about a place to stay in Tuscany. Both shows go to Italy too. Also, George and Silvio both quote the same line from Godfather III: ""Every time I think I'm out, they pull me back in."" 

Seinfeld References in The Sopranos

 ""Junior, mint?"" 

Horses 

Rusty in Seinfeld and Pie-o-My in Sopranos. 
A pony remark ends in death in both shows. First in the episode The Pony Remark when Jerry's comment causes Manya to die. In ""Whoever Did This"" Ralph's comments about Pie-o-My cause his own death at the hands of Tony. 

Jackets

Both series have an episodes about jackets. Sopranos Season 2 ""Full Leather Jacket"" about an awful jacket Richie Aprile gives Tony. 
AJ buys an awful jacket in season 6. 
Seinfeld had an episode titled The Jacket. You also have The Executive beltless trench coat, Jerry's suede jacket, George and the GoreTex, and Puddy's Fur coat and 8 Ball jacket. 

Twin Peaks Influence

I have never seen Twin Peaks but from podcasts I've learned there is a connection.
Mr. and Mrs. Ross on Seinfeld were also on Twin Peaks. The Soprano's dream sequences are influenced by it as well. 


The Kennedys

The Kennedy family is referenced both series throughout. Seinfeld did the JKF Parody, John John was in Elaine's exercise class, George and Jerry went to JFK High School, Mr. Pitt played tennis against Ethel Kennedy, Peterman buys JFK's golf clubs. In the Sopranos you have the episode Camelot where Tony meets a former girlfriend on JFK, shows off his JFK Captain's hat, and talks about his respect for him. 

Both series had controversial episodes centered around ethnic holidays. Seinfeld's ""The Puerto Rican Day Parade"" and The Soprano's ""Christopher"" about Columbus Day. 

Yearning for More/Shows within shows

In season 3 of Seinfeld Kramer leaves for LA to make it big as an actor, which is echoed in season 2 of Sopranos when Christopher considers being a screenwriter. They both write, have awkward encounters with established stars (Favreau ad Savage) and
They both end up right back where they started. 
Later on Christopher would pitch, produce, and release ""Cleaver"" a semi autobiographical horror film. In Seinfeld, Jerry and George pitch, write and produce a semi autobiographical sitcom called ""Jerry"". The Jerry sitcom would come back multiple times including the finale when it's picked up again by NBC.

Meals and Food

The use of food, meals, eating with friend and foe alike cannot be overstated. It's Seinfeld's Monks to Sopranos Satriales. Mendy's to Vesuvio. Meals and how they form bonds is omnipresent in both shows from the beginning.

Related to the food is how destructive both shows are to restaurants. Tony blows up Vesuvio, Jerry and his gange put Babu's restaurant out of business, along with the Soup Nazi, Poppies, and a Kenny Rogers Roasters franchise. 


Classic Rock is used extensively in both, more so in the Sopranos, but both use Slow Ride by Foghat. 


Rival Gangs

NY in The Sopranos, Bizarre group and Van Buren Boys in Seinfeld.


Uncle Junior is to Tony as Uncle Leo is to Jerry
Cousin Brian- Cousin Jeffrey

Board Game fights- Bobby and Tony over Monopoly or Kramer and Newman over Risk. 

Del Boca Vista and Boca Raton. Both end in disaster. Junior is outed as a sushi eater and Frank Costanza is forced to leave Florida because of vagrants sleeping in a Cadillac.

Which brings us to Cadillacs. Jerry buys his parents a Cadillac. Multiple episodes feature it including a two parted titled ""The Cadillac"". Most characters in the Sopranos drive some version of a Cadillac from Tony's Escalade to Paulie's Coupe De Ville. 

Both Shows make extensive use of cigars. All the main characters in Seinfeld smoke them, multiple plots revolve around them including a burned cabin, real Cubans, and Todd Gak. 
Tony Soprano smokes his trademark cigar in the opening credits and never stops. 

Priests and Rabbis are pivotal characters in both shows.

George and Jerry get accidentally outed like Vito Spatafore. Drastically different results.

Both shows got darker as they aged. By Season 9 Jerry is drugging a woman to play with her vintage toys while Tony is murdering his nephew. 

The Use of Parents.

Parents loom large in both shows. On Seinfeld Jerry's parents are the most normal but the have foibles. Elaine has an alcoholic distant father, Kramer has mom issues, and George is damaged for life. Frank and Estelle Costanza did as much damage to George as Johnny and Livia Soprano did to their kids. Volatile dads, moms you can't please, passive aggressive, mean, violent, loud, cunning, etc. 


So it's no surprise that George is Tony and Tony is George. 
The similar parents, both IQ obsessed (George cheats on an IQ test/Tony Talks about his), revenge orientated(like George trying to slip his boss a Mickey or creating a fake charity) Both fight dirty, George with the hair pulling and crotch stuff, Tony in his day to day life. 
Both had issues with a high school coach-gym teacher. George is dubbed CantStandYa  by his and given atomic wedges while Tony has a recurring a dream about shooting his former football coach and how he's not prepared. 
Mr. Bevilaqua is George's gym teacher while Matthew Bevilaqua tries to kill Christopher and Tony has to kill him. 
Art Vandelay = Kevin Finnerty
George drapes himself in velvet. Tony is no stranger to velvet looking sweat suits. 
Both men ruin or damage multiple businesses. George with the Penske File, the Yankee memorabilia he destroys, lying about the Human Fund, lying to Play Now about his handicap, bankrupts Frank's computer business. 
Tony ruins Vesuvio, bankrupts Scatino's Sporting Goods, The Chicken Market.
Both men sleep with cleaning women. George at his office and Tony with Svetlana. Both incidents cause more grief than it's worth. 
Elaine once calls George a bad seed that gets into the bloodstream. The same could be said about Tony. 

Jerry= Silvio. The gang hangs out at their respective places, they both have new gorgeous women every week, quick witted, distinctive big hair, have plenty of cash, both seem to be Even Steven, they are even keel for the most part. Jerry acts as a consigliere to George as Sil is to Tony.  He and Kramer also have a Sil-Paulie sort of friendship. 

George and Susan are similar to Chris and Adriana. They Both indirectly killed their fiancée after a long history of lies and abuse. Since knowing George, Susan had her parent's cabin burned down, got fired from NBC, had her father outed, was turned to lesbianism, he tried to cheat on her with Marisa Tomei and tried to get out of their wedding multiple times. His cheapness saved him in the end. 
Chris on the other hand beat Ade, killed her dog, ruined her music manager career, caused her mom to attempt suicide, cheated on her all the time, and was a general all around piece of shit until she confided in him and her had her killed.  

Kramer = Paulie 
Older, single, fit, Mom issues, stint in the Army, Distinctive clothes and hair, both get worried about anything medical related, both wear wife beater type t shirts. They both get stranded in the woods and have issues with a specific painting.

Finally both shows end where they began. In the Soprano's series finale at the diner AJ reminds Tony of his line from the Season 1 finale to ""always remember the good times"" Tony doesn't remember saying it. 
In the Seinfeld Finale as the gang sits in jail(but in their diner spots), Jerry quotes from the pilot ""To me that button is in the worst possible spot. Second button is the key button, it literally makes or breaks the shirt.' 
George replies, 'Haven't we had this conversation before? 
You Think? Yeah I guess we have""

489,Kramer fans are not real fans...,"I've heard a lot of people say (not on this sub tho, I'm new to this sub) that Kramer fans are not relly fans because they just watched the show casually (or even just clips) and he was the character that stuck out the most because of his physical comedy and funny sounds.

**I strongly disagree with that**

I've seen all seasons (some of them multiple times) and I'm a HUGE Kramer fan...

Not because of his physical comedy or his hilariously dumb ideas but because of his character.

Kramer is open and unfiltered... he will always tell you what he's thinking, and eventhough it may suck it's still better than being lied to.

He's open minded and loves people... He even lets random asian tourists sleep in his apartment.

He is REALLY comfortable with his Friends, always overstepping boundaries and invading personal spaces without malicious intent or even noticing.


Kramer may be really weird and ""over the top"" (lets face it... Kramer would not ""work"" in real life) but that's just the part that's played for comedy... 

If you take away all the goofyness and strange behavior that makes him funny and just look at his character you'll realise that Kramer is actually the nicest person... And THAT'S why they are all friends with him and don't mind when he's raiding their fridges.

8,One-Off Characters That Should Have Been Brought Back for The Finale.,"Now that its been over twenty years since the finale aired I thought this would be an interesting topic as to which characters that only made one appearance on Seinfeld should have been brought back for the finale. Three instantly come to mind for me:

3. Jean-Paul from ""The Hot Tub"" this was my favorite character from that season and he would have been a terrfic character witness since he not only was screwed over by both Jerry and Elaine but also by Kramer.

2. Timmy from ""The Implant"" he is the guy who famously accused George of double-dipping a chip at a funeral home.

1. Jimmy from ""The Jimmy"" this goes without saying that Jimmy was perfectly used in the absolute perfect amount. One episode. Any more and his whole schtick would have been stale.

This is a great way to separate the wheat from the chaff, because if they answer it correctly (there are 18 different ""correct"" answers), you know that they are familiar with the following: **a)** the writer Larry Charles (some will respond ""don't you mean Larry David?"" - which I of course take offense to: do you seriously think I can't tell Larry Charles from Larry David??), **b)** some episodes written by him, and **c)** names of particular episodes.

If they respond with a ""correct"" answer (for example The Subway, The Bris, or The Limo), and then add that ""it was a shame that he left after season 5"" you know that you're conversing with an educated fan. However, if they respond with something like ""who?"" you know it's safe to tell them to get the hell out of your sight.

Funny thing, the spanish subtitles (even the officials on Sony, which transmits seinfeld here) always translate ""climb"" instead of ""clam"" and ""scallop"" as ""scale"".

-Fui a escalar el otro día,
y olvidé lavar las botas.

-Sí. Fui a escalar y trepar.



-Escalé y trepé.

412,Seinfeld conspiracy theory (with absolutely no evidence to back it up),"To this day I am throughly convinced that the season 3 finale, “The Keys” was originally intended to be the launching pad for a Kramer spinoff.

Seinfeld, at this time was a solid show but not quite yet the monster it would soon be. After 3 years and some solid ratings, I think the network saw an opportunity to spotlight Kramer with his own show, set in LA as a struggling actor. Something (no idea what) happened between the season 3 finale and the season 4 premier that scrapped this idea. Maybe NBC  saw where Seinfeld was heading and knew losing Kramer would amount to a death blow or maybe someone figured out that Kramer, as a show lead, would run its course fairly soon.
Regardless, I am convinced that “The Keys” was the jumping off point for all of this but was quickly scrapped and each cast member was told to never speak of it (the conspiracy).",seinfeld,1533203385,MetraConductor,45,104,True,2018-08-02

The chemistry between the cast, the writing, the acting, not so much Jerry, because let's face it, he's a great comedian but not such a great actor.
The writing, the simplicity of it all. Just blows me away.
When I watched the last episode, I hated the fact that it ended. Yes I'll watch it again, but to know that it's over, really bites. I honestly think they could have gone on for many seasons, but I totally understand going out on top and not jumping the shark, which in my opinion they never did.

102,Seinfeld-esque story of Frank Sinatra's daughter during airing of final Seinfeld episode.,"I read this on the New York Times yesterday. Quite ironic, because it is reminiscent of a Seinfeld plot line...and it happened during the airing the final episode.

""At 9 p.m. on May 14 that year, more than 76 million Americans settled down to watch the finale of “Seinfeld,” the NBC sitcom that was ending after a nine-season run.

Among them was Frank Sinatra’s daughter Nancy, who lived just five blocks away from her father. She later said that she’d planned on visiting her father that day, but had gotten engrossed in the farewell to Jerry, Elaine, George and Kramer.

Sadly, about 14 minutes into the show, a 911 call was placed from Mr. Sinatra’s home in Beverly Hills. The singer had suffered a heart attack.

The ambulance, which arrived just four minutes after the emergency call, raced through Los Angeles — the streets were deserted because most people were glued to the television. But Mr. Sinatra, 82, never recovered.
“My greatest sadness is that I wasn’t there when he died,” Ms. Sinatra would later reveal.

Ms. Sinatra’s stepmother, Barbara, was at the hospital but, Nancy Sinatra said, nobody called her until after he died, causing a rift in the family.

“I know that in order to live a happy life you’re supposed to let go of your anger and move on, but I was five minutes down the road watching TV while my dad was dying,” she said. “That’s something I will never forget, let alone forgive.”

I didn't include The Contest because... for some reason it just doesn't do that much for me. At the beginning of the episode it's assumed by everyone that, chances are, Kramer will be the first to lose. Elaine even mentions it at Monk's. Even as Kramer leaves the window to exit Jerry's apartment, the way he does it, what it suggests is way too obvious. When Kramer slams the money on the table ""I'm out"", it didn't come as a surprise at all and, for me, that made it much less funny. Maybe if Elaine didn't say her line and Kramer took some other opportunity to leave the apartment instead of walk out like that it'd be funnier?

He simply made a suggestion, Babu is the one who decided to go all in with the Pakistani theme. Jerry didn't force him to, he's just a random dude who mentioned an idea. Babu should have evaluated the risks before bankrupting himself changing the restaurant.

Furthermore, it is not Jerry's fault that Babu didn't receive his visa renewal papers, either! Mail is mis-delivered all the time. It's only a coincidence that the mail was delivered to Jerry... it could have been another tenant who might have thrown it away or marked it return to sender, which could have led to the exact same outcome. Another tenant could have been on a long vacation or in the hospital. Babu had to have known that his visa was expiring and made sure he renewed it himself instead of waiting for something in the mail.

Babu needs to take a little personal responsibility instead of blaming everyone else for his problems, in my opinion. ",seinfeld,1527014519,glittercheese,24,34,True,2018-05-22

284,"Seincast's interview with Seinfeld writer Peter Mehlman (The Hamptons, The Yada Yada, etc.) was a wasted opportunity","For those who are not aware, Seincast is a decent podcast about the Seinfeld show, where they spend 1-2 hours discussing each episode of the series. I am not sure how many interviews or ""specials"" they have, but early in their Seincast careers they managed to land an interiew with Peter Mehlman, who was a writer on Seinfeld from season 2 to 8 (he's also credited with a season 9 episode, I believe). He also served as a co-executive producer.

In the interview, Peter Mehlman proved a very thoughtful and interesting person. He wasn't shy to express his opinions and frustrations from the year as a Seinfeld staff member.

You could clearly hear how frustrated he was with the last two seasons (even though he holds his ""Yada Yada"" episode (Season 8) very highly), and revealed that he was unhappy with a lot of the content in the last two seasons because he thought it lacked in quality, and that he'd be EMBARRASSED to have his name on an episode like ""The Puerto Rican Day Parade"". Peter Mehlman thought the episode was so awful that he'd be embarrassed to have his name associated with it! This is headline stuff.

What do Matt and Vinny do when they hear this? They COMPLETELY CHANGE THE SUBJECT! A Seinfeld writer was ready to vent his frustrations with the direction of a celebrated show in its latter years and the interviewers completely piss away this opportunity.

Who else wouldn't have loved to hear more about what and why disliked so much with seasons 8 and 9? He was clearly a topic Mehlman was fired up to discuss more.",seinfeld,1527581669,BarryHero,5,3,True,2018-05-29
